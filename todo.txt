Todo list:

Make mesh into an object (do this before going to 2D)

Unify file opens for different modes to not duplicate code (ad_, im_, etc)

Implement subroutine in module 'mesh' that takes a function of ixa and ixr and multiplies matrix elements by that function - less things outside of mesh need to know about how we store matrix.

autotools:
-Include support for procdenextra in automake
-check for gnuplot - make optional or warn or something, since it is not needed for running? AC_CHECK_PROG

Copy library files to local directory for more portability
-maybe... what about HPCC apps where HPCC libs are more optimized for arch?

Add unit conversion module
 -see how GNU Scientific Library or ROOT does it?

Change sh scripts to use the ${SED} and ${AWK} variables that are set by configure.ac
 -maybe have a script that is called inside every analysis script that sets global things? Then configure.ac will only have to modify and know about one script.

Convert complex*16 to complex (cLong), defining cLong in prec_def

Investigate migrating from autotools to another, like scons, cmake, waf, gyp?

Make gprof-able FFTW library

with gfortran 4.6, use -M to autogenerate makefile module dependency rules

create make target to change compile options for debugging (it makes the code slower)

Convert to non-recursive Makefiles to hopefully stop building entire src tree for small test codes.

Make iflag module to define constants so we can say iflag=IFLAG_VERBOSE and such in function calls for debugging output - add to bmath_dZeroBrent, for example.

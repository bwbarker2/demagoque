Todo list:

Make mesh into an object (do this before going to 2D)

Unify file opens for different modes to not duplicate code (ad_, im_, etc)
-implement getNextUnit to never worry about file unit numbers
--can use INQUIRE intrinsic function

Implement subroutine in module 'mesh' that takes a function of ixa and ixr and multiplies matrix elements by that function - less things outside of mesh need to know about how we store matrix.

Create makefile to use instead
-with support for procdenextra as well
-intermediate step to automake?

Copy library files to local directory for more portability
-maybe... what about HPCC apps where HPCC libs are more optimized for arch?

Start using documentation - doxygen or robodoc (does any format, cross-refs)

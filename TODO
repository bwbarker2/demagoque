Todo list:

Make mesh into an object (do this before going to 2D)

Unify file opens for different modes to not duplicate code (ad_, im_, etc)
-implement getNextUnit to never worry about file unit numbers
--can use INQUIRE intrinsic function

Implement subroutine in module 'mesh' that takes a function of ixa and ixr and multiplies matrix elements by that function - less things outside of mesh need to know about how we store matrix.

autotools:
-Include support for procdenextra in automake
-check for gnuplot - make optional or warn or something, since it is not needed for running? AC_CHECK_PROG

Copy library files to local directory for more portability
-maybe... what about HPCC apps where HPCC libs are more optimized for arch?

Add error handling module - for example, see http://sourceware.org/autobook/autobook/autobook_54.html#SEC54

Add unit conversion module
 -see how GNU Scientific Library or ROOT does it?

Change sh scripts to use the ${SED} and ${AWK} variables that are set by configure.ac
 -maybe have a script that is called inside every analysis script that sets global things? Then configure.ac will only have to modify and know about one script.

Convert complex*16 to complex (cLong), defining cLong in prec_def

Investigate migrating from autotools to another, like scons, cmake, waf, gyp?
